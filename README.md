# Understanding-the-Nutrition-Transition
This data set contains socio-demographic variables, focused on overweight rates and its drivers, on 154 countries from 1990-2022.

This repository contains the data to evaluate how globalization and modernization contribute to rising overweight prevalence across different country groups. I used it to create a two-fixed effects model, finding that modernization is a more significant driver of overweight rates than globalization. I hope this dataset will support further research into nutrition and its social determinants.
